# Project: Upwork_JudgesUSACounties

I'm currently engaged in the development of a website dedicated to my non-profit foundation. The groundwork for the website has already been laid out on the GoDaddy platform. This endeavor entails a fairly intricate undertaking, involving the implementation of numerous dropdown menus and options.

For instance, the scope of my organization encompasses five states within the United States: California, Florida, Georgia, Colorado, and New York.

Consequently, upon landing on the homepage, users will be prompted to select their respective state. Upon choosing their state, an introductory page will guide them to select their county. Once on the county-specific page, they will have access to profiles of the elected judges for that jurisdiction, which can be further explored by clicking on hyperlinks for more in-depth information.
